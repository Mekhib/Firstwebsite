        <p>love software. I love the complex intricacies of code and the fluidity of an optimized UI.
            I have always been fascinated with how the hardware of a computer interacts with its software and vise
            versa.
            I’ve been told on countless occasions that I should narrow my area of study from the relatively broad
            computer science to something more refined and specific.
            To me, however, having a degree with such a broad range of applications and knowledge of coding languages in
            a world where technology is rapidly changing is more valuable than ever before.</span>

        <p>I have extremely high ambitions for myself.
            My dream occupation is to be Chief Executive Officer of the Microsoft. Bill Gates is someone I look up to,
            not just because of his phenomenal philanthropy work, but because he, along with Paul Allen created the best
            computing operating system on the planet with windows, dominated the productivity space with Microsoft
            Office and Powerpoint and helped shaped computing as we know it.
            The other person I look up to is Satya Nadella. His work in cloud computing is legendary and I love how he
            rejuvenated Microsoft with new, innovate hardware and software.
            He managed to become CEO of Microsoft with his masters in Computer Science and that gives me hope that I
            could do the same.
            My friends and family support my technology endeavors, yet they do not understand why I choose a field in
            technology, as opposed to something like a doctor.
            I always tell them the same thing: I can save a life with a scalpel by creating the technology used to power
            the surgery.
            It’s not about what you learn, it's about what you do with it that makes the difference.
